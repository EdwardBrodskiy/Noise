# Neon Art

This project originated from a simple aspiration: crafting captivating patterns and artwork using fundamental C++ canvas tools. Over time, it evolved into creating a distinct style of neon glow artwork for another project, and generating striking background images that I still use to this day. You're welcome to delve into the repository folders to view some of the generated images, or feel free to generate your own mesmerizing neon art.
